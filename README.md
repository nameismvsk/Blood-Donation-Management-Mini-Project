# Blood Donation Management Mini Project

## Project Overview
This mini-project is a simple **database solution** for managing blood donor information. It helps track **donors**, their **health status**, **blood group**, **donation status**, and **last donation date**. This project serves as a **foundation** for applications in healthcare, non-profit organizations, or blood banks, aiming to streamline donor management.

## Features
1. **Donor Information Management**:
   - Store essential donor details such as **names**, **addresses**, **phone numbers**, and **blood groups**.
   
2. **Donation Tracking**:
   - Monitor the **status** of donations (e.g., "Completed", "Pending") and record the **last donation date**.

3. **Health Status**:
   - Record the donor's **blood health status** (e.g., "Healthy", "Needs Attention") to ensure safety.

4. **Eligibility Identification**:
   - Query **donors eligible** for their next donation based on their health and **previous donation dates**.

## Setup Instructions
1. Copy the **SQL code** provided into your SQL editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or any SQL-supported IDE).
2. **Execute the code step-by-step**:
   - Create the **database** and **table**.
   - **Insert sample data** into the table.
